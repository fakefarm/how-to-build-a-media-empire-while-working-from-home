## Comments 
- you sit on a computer and get tons of information.
- you are a one-person media outlet
- but you give your github because that's popular and people use it to validate you.
- but, look at these github profiles - nobody knows who you are
- what you read and see is public information
- it doesn't take much to add a link or two to your profile.
- it's called 'marketing'.
- What is marketing? marketing is telling people what you have and convincing them you are worth buying.
- the resume and linkedin are not for you. they are for non-developers.
- as a developer you don't need a job but you should be able to show people who you are.


- you need to do things in line. you are in a text editor and terminal all day
- with middleman you can!

- i suggest marketing yourself in 3 ways
personal - are you cool?
practice - what do you work on?
professional - we're systems people do you really want to answer emails as a thread? No, go back and forth with what you do and offer.
