Going Further with Middleman
============================
## Description
As a Ruby on Rails developer, you're familiar with building full-stack application development. You've used Rails to develop MVC-based web apps, but how does that fit in with API-based development across multiple teams? We've seen how to use Rails as a JSON API back-end, but how could we use the same great tools weâ€™ve been using in Rails to build front end single page JavaScript apps? In this talk, we'll show how Middleman can help.


## Abstract
Middleman is known as a static Ruby website generator, but it can do so much more. We'll go further with Middleman and use it to build a scalable and responsive front-end JavaScript app that works with a Rails-based API on the backend. We'll develop the application in 4 iterations:
* Plain-vanilla static web application.
* AngularJS application with static data.
* AngularJS front-end with stub API.
* AngularJS application using a real API.


## What Do I Get Out of It?
Attendees will learn:
* How to leverage Middleman to create single page JavaScript apps within a Rails environment.
* Reduce / eliminate a web app's dependencies on backends and APIs.
* Workflows, tools, and techniques to iteratively add new functionality.


## Prerequisites
* Prior knowledge of Ruby on Rails
* Basic concepts with JavaScript and Node.js
* Familiarity with AngularJS
* Understanding of RESTful APIs and JSON
