## Intro

- i'm dave
- want to show you a way to build a media empire
- there are some stereotypes and objections

## Stereotypes
### 1. You need to make money

- clients
- job

so what's the first step to make money? To get people to know who you are. Another way to say it is... MARKETING (GASP!)

ok how do i market myself? It's easier to think of yourself as a brand, and differentiate yourself from you. 

If that's too abstract, I think of it as the 3P's

Personal
- blog
- photos
- links

Professional
- what do you do?
- prove it (portfolio)

Practice
this is kind of a new one. most developers don't think their toys and practice are important but it's the DELTA. it's the trend line. it's where you're going.
I use a site I call fake farm - with pet projects.

So, we can talk about more of that if you want but the idea of marketing is just to put this information in public.

### blurb about github / marketing
With Middleman, you are pushing commits to your github. So, Back on marketing for a moment. It's a pretty common request and willingness to send over a github account. So, let's take a look at some developers evidence they know what they're doing. [show some githubs of anonymous]. Perectpion is reality and from teh looks of these accounts, they don't convey a sense that these people are passionate developers. Make your github look lively with middleman.
