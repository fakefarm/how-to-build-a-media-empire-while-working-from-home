## Comments 
- you sit on a computer and get tons of information.
- you are a one-person media outlet
- but you give your github because that's popular and people use it to validate you.
- but, look at these github profiles - nobody knows who you are
- what you read and see is public information
- it doesn't take much to add a link or two to your profile.
- it's called 'marketing'.
- What is marketing? marketing is telling people what you have and convincing them you are worth buying.
- the resume and linkedin are not for you. they are for non-developers.
- as a developer you don't need a job but you should be able to show people who you are.


- you need to do things in line. you are in a text editor and terminal all day
- with middleman you can!

- i suggest marketing yourself in 3 ways
personal - are you cool?
practice - what do you work on?
professional - we're systems people do you really want to answer emails as a thread? No, go back and forth with what you do and offer.

## GIST:

### How to build a media empire while working from home.
Or, the benefits and potential of using middleman to build static websites.

As a developer you can say anything you want online. However, many developers don't say much because they lack the content or the ability to post online with minimal friction. Dave is going to discuss the potential of using Middleman to align and automate your content. 


## Reviewing blogs

### dynamic pages
https://middlemanapp.com/advanced/dynamic_pages/

- make a template for things like links.

`current_page`, `current_article`

I've tried at least 15 different blogging platforms. My most favorite is Middleman. It has all of my favorites combined.

### write in markdown

I always hated how Word tried to format things while I'm writing. Totally distracted me from whatever I was doing. Word and Pages are known as _Rich Text_ editors. Markdown is a _Plain Text_ and has formatting I can do without it getting in the way.

### write offline

I love the ability to write without an online dashboard and intenet connection blocking me from writing.

### Write with a Text Editor

I have become so accustomed to my shortcuts that I try to write everything in my editor and then copy/paste it.

### platform is ruby

I love that I get to manage the guts in `Ruby`, rather than `php` or `node`

### static site

As a static site, middleman is fast.

### free hosting

Need I say more? Middleman can be hosted on github.

### extensible

Middleman is great that I can add extra pages or custom styling with little to no trouble.

### Version controlled

Since I'm building on git, I have my history in the event I want to go back in time.
